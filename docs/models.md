### What type of entity types will I need:
* Not to sure on this question to be honest. I have an idea now after the readings this week. I know that fragments in a view model are going to work better for me. 
* Really rotating through a story fragment, a choices fragment, then a fragment that would jump me to a camera would fit. 
  * So using within those, stories pull out what plot points are coming up.
  * From the camera it should jump directly to the choices. Using buttons dependant upon how many possible inputs were found. 
* The input image:
* Player
* Theme:
  
### What fields for the entites?
* Story:
  * Strings
  * id: long
* Choices: 
  * strings in buttons
  * id: long
* For the image:
  * id: long
  * name: string
  * value: long (percent of how accurate it could be)
* Player: 
  * id: long or long?
  * player name: string
* Theme: String

### Attributes 
* phew not to certain, is there a better way then strings? will I have spaces to input the choices into buttons?
* scrolling text? Audio, dang who knows. 

I think I have a general idea of the layout now and an idea of how to do it after this last week. Fragments make way more sense for doing this. 
I should be able to work through this. Still working on how I can actually pull out the strings I want and need from these pictures.
